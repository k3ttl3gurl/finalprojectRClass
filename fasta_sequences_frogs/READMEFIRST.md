# Caveat About Data
These entries were collected looking especially to COI cytochrome DNA collection. I however noticed while completing my tree that while they are a well described species with regards to SRA data, they are less so when it comes to their own mitochrondrial DNA and actually have an error in the genus Dendropsophus. I felt worth mentioning here. 

In the future, if able I would resolve this or bring in additional species to help resolve this tree issue.
