# Processing_code folder

This folder contains code for processing data.

I worked cleaning and doing an initial visualization of the human microbiome data, then I did a quick clean through already clean data from an amphibian microbiome study. 

This was to demonstrate what it takes to actually be able to clean through these types of large files, but also taught me a lot of what knowledge gaps I will have to fill to work with microbiome. 

The most important element is keeping straight which is which:

Human Microbiome: 
cleaning_microbiomedat.R
visualize_microbiomedat.R

Amphibian Microbiome:
cleaningfrogdata.R
