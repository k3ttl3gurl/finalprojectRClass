"JACOBS_IBD_RELATIVES_2016","Untargeted","UPLC-MS - both positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI-) electrospray ionization modes","The MS data were processed using MassLynx software (Waters Corp) to get the retention time, m/z, and intensity for each ion. 3206 ions were detected in the positive mode and 1420 ions in the negative mode. Authors' in-house program was used to putatively identify ions, using HMDB, LipidMaps, KEGG, and BioCyc. The m/z values were used to putatively assign IDs to the ions by neutral mass elucidation, which was accomplished by considering the possible adducts (H+, Na+, and/or NH4+ in the ESI+ mode; and H- and Cl- in the ESI- mode). The masses then were compared with the exact mass of small molecules in the databases, from which putative metabolites were identified with a mass error of 20 ppm or less. MS/MS validation was performed by comparing the fragmentation pattern of each metabolite and lipid of interest against either that of its pure chemical form or its published MS/MS spectra in Metlin or our in-house database. Validation was performed for 123 spectral features, of which 37 were validated successfully.","Metabolites in the published data were identified by m/z and retention time, in either positive or negative ionization mode. A subset was validated against reference standards and annotated by name. We only mapped this subset to HMDB and KEGG.","4626","MetaboAnalyst + manual mapping for additional metabolites (validation by name + mass)","36","A ""Positive"" or ""Negative"" prefix was added to metabolite identifiers to indicate whether the metabolite record originated in the positive (ESI + ) or negative (ESI - ) electrospray ionization mode."
"POYET_BIO_ML_2019","Untargeted","Four complimentary LC-MS methods: Two hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) methods were used for the analysis of water soluble polar metabolites in positive (HILIC-pos) or negative (HILIC-neg) ion mode, and two reverse-phase chromatography methods for measuring lipids in positive ionization mode (C8-pos) or metabolites of intermediate polarity using a C18 column in negative ionization mode (C18-neg).","Raw data were processed using TraceFinder 3.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA) and Progenesis QI (Nonlinear Dynamics; Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). Metabolite identities were confirmed using authentic reference standards or reference samples.","A text file per LC-MS method was available at Metabolomics Workbench Project ID PR000804. In each file, only metabolite names are provided. Further information per metabolite is available in Metabolomics Workbench.","489","MetaboAnalyst + manual mapping for additional metabolites","255","A prefix was concatenated to each metabolite to indicate from which method it originated: ""HILIC_NEG"", ""HILIC_POS"", ""REV_NEG"" (reverse-phase chromatography in negative ionization mode), or ""REV_POS""  (reverse-phase chromatography in positive ionization mode)."

"KIM_ADENOMAS","Untargeted","Four UPLC-MS/MS methods: Two separate reverse phase (RP)/UPLC-MS/MS analyses (optimized for relatively hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, respectively) with positive-ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI); Another RP/UPLC-MS/MS analysis with negative-ion mode ESI; HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS analysis with negative-ion mode ESI.","Compounds were identified using a chemical library, which is based on authenticated standards and maintained by Metabolon, that contains the retention time/index (RI), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and chromatographic data (including MS/MS spectral data) on all chemicals present in the library. Biochemical identifications are based on three criteria: i) RI within a narrow window of the proposed identification, ii) accurate mass match to the library +/- 10 ppm, and iii) the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the experimental data and authentic standards. The MS/MS scores are based on a comparison of the ions present in the experimental spectrum to the ions present in the library spectrum.","Metabolites in the data (from supp. information) were identified by name only.","462","MetaboAnalyst + manual mapping for additional metabolites","358","Original metabolite identifiers were unchanged."
