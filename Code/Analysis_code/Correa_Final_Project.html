<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This is a replicated microbiome analysis using only frogs, inspired
by a broader amphibian study that compared salamander and frog skin
microbiota. The original dataset structure was a bit messy, but it
revealed some interesting patterns. I processed the data, rarefied the
OTU table, and performed indicator species analysis by habitat type.</p>

Analysis by Habitat</h1>
<p>Frogs sampled from pine-oak forests exhibited a unique set of
indicator bacterial taxa that were largely absent from those found in
fir and cloud forests. Interestingly, fir and cloud forest frogs shared
more similarities in their microbiomes. This suggests a strong influence
of habitat type on microbial composition.</p>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Results show that habitat has a stronger influence than host
phylogeny at shallow taxonomic levels (e.g., within genera/species).
While phylogenetic relatedness might explain differences at broader
taxonomic scales, environmental factors seem to be the primary driver of
microbial diversity in this frog-focused subset.</p>

<p>Frogs from the same habitat tended to share more OTUs than those from
different habitats. The presence of unique indicator taxa suggests
possible environmental filtering by microhabitat conditions like
moisture, elevation, and substrate. This aligns with findings from
previous amphibian microbiome studies, which showed that site and
habitat can be stronger predictors of microbial community structure than
host taxonomy.</p>
<h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Environmental microbiome samples were not included, so we can’t
fully assess substrate influence.</li>
<li>All frogs sampled were from montane forest regions, so broader
environmental conclusions are limited.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Despite the limited scope, this replication using frogs supports the
original study’s findings: habitat plays a critical role in shaping
amphibian skin microbiomes. Even in the absence of phylogenetic depth,
clear differences in microbial community structure emerge across
habitats. Changes in habitat — through deforestation or climate shifts —
may result in altered microbiome composition, potentially increasing
vulnerability to pathogens like <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>
(Bd).</p>
