"(1) ‘Yes’ indicates that the raw data required demultiplexing, ‘No’ indicates it was already demultiplexed;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"(2) ‘Right trimming’ is the length to which all sequences were trimmed as part of the DADA2 algorithm. Reads with shorter lengths are discarded. For most datasets we chose to trim sequences to the location where the median quality dropped below 30. In cases of relatively high-quality reads, we chose a threshold so that we maintain at least 99.9% of the reads. In cases of relatively low-quality reads, we adopted the same thresholds as those used in the original study.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"(3) ‘Left trimming’ is the number of nt’s trimmed from the beginning of each sequence in order to remove primers/adapters;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"(4) ‘Yes’ indicates that paired end reads were merged, as part of DADA pipeline. ‘No’ indicates that even though raw data included paired reads, only forward reads were chosen due to inability to maintain a high-quality overlap required for merging. ‘NA’ indicates the data was single-end;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
